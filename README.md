# paken
Paken is a python string scanner lib that can be use to scan password maybe. :3
For now it's written in Indonesian and only run in single thread yet.

The script is made in windows using python 3.5

Note :
  The callback function must have a return value of True to tell if the result string is equal to string that's going to be scanned. See sample.py file.
