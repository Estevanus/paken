# paken
Paken is a python string scanner lib that can be use to scan password maybe. :3
For now it's written in Indonesian and only run in single thread yet.

The script is made in windows using python 3.5
The script seems to work in IronPython 2.7.5 too.

Note :
  The callback function must have a return value of True when the result is found or it will keep looping all the way through.
